This is where all my work on game balance and probability theory will be stored.

2d6 prabability - Work on probability theory. Here I was able to clearly show the behavior of the 2d6 cube, which will help you use it in new projects.

Weapon Balance - I show you clearly how to balance a simple weapon in an ordinary game.
